Step 1: Set up the Project (send in git)
Create a new Node.js Express project.
Install necessary packages: express, mongoose, @types/express, @types/mongoose, ts-node, and typescript.
Create a tsconfig.json file for TypeScript configuration.
Create the folder structure:
bash
Copy code
/src
  /models
  /routes
  /controllers
  /middlewares
Create an app.ts file to set up your Express application.
Create a config.ts file for configuration settings.
Create a MongoDB database using Mongoose for storing user and order data.


Step 2: Define Data Models (done) send in git
Create a user.interface.ts file for the User interface.
Create a order.interface.ts file for the Order interface.
Create a user.model.ts file for the Mongoose User model.
Create an order.model.ts file for the Mongoose Order model.



Step 3: User Management
3.1 Create a new user (done)
Create a user.controller.ts file for handling user-related logic.
Create a user.routes.ts file for user-related routes.
Implement the POST /api/users endpoint to create a new user.
3.2 Retrieve a list of all users (done)
Implement the GET /api/users endpoint to retrieve a list of users.
3.3 Retrieve a specific user by ID (done)
Implement the GET /api/users/:userId endpoint to retrieve a specific user by ID.
3.4 Update user information (face trouble with this)-done
Implement the PUT /api/users/:userId endpoint to update user information.
3.5 Delete a user(easy one done)
Implement the DELETE /api/users/:userId endpoint to delete a user.



Step 4: Order Management (done)
4.1 Add New Product in Order
Create an order.controller.ts file for handling order-related logic.
Create an order.routes.ts file for order-related routes.
Implement the PUT /api/users/:userId/orders endpoint to add a new product to the user's orders.
4.2 Retrieve all orders for a specific user
Implement the GET /api/users/:userId/orders endpoint to retrieve all orders for a specific user.
4.3 Calculate Total Price of Orders for a Specific User
Implement the GET /api/users/:userId/orders/total-price endpoint to calculate the total price of orders for a specific user.



Step 5: Validation with Joi/Zod
Install joi or zod for data validation.
Implement validation for user and order creation and updating operations.
Handle validation errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages in the API responses.



Step 6: Test and Debug
Test each endpoint using tools like Postman.
Debug and refine your code as needed.


Step 7: Documentation
Document your API endpoints, including request and response formats.
By following these steps, you'll gradually build a Node.js Express application with TypeScript, MongoDB, and Mongoose, implementing user and order management with proper data models, validations, and API routes.
