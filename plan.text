Step 1: Project Setup (done)
Initialize Project: 

Create a new directory for your project.
Run npm init to set up your package.json.
Install required dependencies: express, mongoose, bcrypt, joi (or zod), and @types/node for TypeScript.
Set up TypeScript: 

Install TypeScript globally: npm install -g typescript.
Create a tsconfig.json file with the necessary compiler options.
Create Project Structure: 

Organize your project structure:

/src
  /models
  /routes
  /controllers
  /middlewares


  
Step 2: Database Setup (done)
Set up MongoDB: 

Create a MongoDB database and collect connection details.
Create Mongoose Models:

Define Mongoose models for User and Order in the models directory.
Apply the appropriate data types and validations using Mongoose.

Step 3: Implement User Management
Create a New User:

Implement the POST /api/users endpoint.
Use bcrypt to hash the password before storing it in the database.
Retrieve a List of Users:

Implement the GET /api/users endpoint.
Apply field filtering to exclude sensitive information.
Retrieve a Specific User by ID:

Implement the GET /api/users/:userId endpoint.
Handle the case when the user is not found.
Update User Information:

Implement the PUT /api/users/:userId endpoint.
Update user data and handle the case when the user is not found.
Delete a User:

Implement the DELETE /api/users/:userId endpoint.
Handle the case when the user is not found.
Step 4: Implement Order Management
Add New Product in Order:

Implement the PUT /api/users/:userId/orders endpoint.
Check if the user exists before adding the order.
Retrieve All Orders for a Specific User:

Implement the GET /api/users/:userId/orders endpoint.
Handle the case when the user is not found.
Calculate Total Price of Orders:

Implement the GET /api/users/:userId/orders/total-price endpoint.
Handle the case when the user is not found.
Step 5: Bonus Section - Validation
Use Joi/Zod for Validation:
Implement validation for user and order creation and updating.
Ensure that data adheres to the defined models.
Handle validation errors gracefully in API responses.
Step 6: Error Handling and Response Format
Standardize Error Responses:
Create a standard format for error responses.
Use this format consistently across the API.
Step 7: Testing
Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for each endpoint and functionality.
Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
Integration Testing:

Test the integration of your endpoints.
Ensure the API behaves as expected.
Step 8: Documentation
API Documentation:
Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or apidoc.
Step 9: Run and Test the Application
Run the Application:

Start your Express server and test the endpoints.
Test Endpoints:

Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test each API endpoint.
